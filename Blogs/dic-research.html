                    <p>This post recounts my first research internship experience at the Design and Innovation Center
                        (DIC)
                        at Panjab University. The DIC is one of twenty such centers established by the Indian government
                        to
                        foster a culture of innovation. I first became aware of this opportunity through a senior at my
                        IEEE
                        Student Branch, which I was a member of at the time.</p>

                    <p>
                        I worked on a project related to maintaining the efficiency of solar panels, particularly during
                        the
                        intense heat of summer. The problem is that after reaching a specific temperature, the
                        efficiency of
                        solar panels in producing energy begins to decrease. For instance, if a solar panel has a
                        temperature coefficient of -0.38% per degree Celsius, its efficiency will drop by 0.38% for
                        every
                        degree above 25°C. Conversely, for every degree below 25°C, its efficiency increases by the same
                        amount. This means that cooler, sunny weather is actually the optimal condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My project, therefore, involved developing a cooling mechanism so that solar panels could
                        maintain
                        an optimum temperature and produce energy more efficiently. During the internship, I devised and
                        implemented a water-based cooling mechanism, established an Arduino microcontroller-based system
                        to
                        regulate the panel temperature using control algorithms, and successfully constructed a
                        functional
                        small-scale prototype to validate the effectiveness of the entire system.

                    <p>Working on this project taught me a valuable lesson. I used to think that I needed to know
                        everything
                        before starting something new. However, I've learned that it's all about learning *while*
                        working.
                        You don't need to be an expert to begin; you can simply start and learn as you go. This is a
                        principle I will carry with me for a lifetime. I also had the amazing opportunity to showcase my
                        project at the 'All India DIC MEET' in Delhi, presenting to students and professors from all
                        over
                        the country.</p>

                    <h2>How I Got the Internship</h2>
                    <p>As a fresher, I didn't have much experience. I had explored a few technologies, but I was eager
                        to
                        work on a real project. I approached a senior who was already engaged in a project at DIC and
                        expressed my interest. He posed some technical questions and asked if I knew how to program an
                        Arduino. Knowing nothing about it, I admitted my lack of knowledge but emphasized my willingness
                        to
                        learn quickly if given the chance.</p>
                    <p>He gave me one week to learn Arduino and basic circuit design and to propose a solution to a
                        problem
                        statement. I successfully accomplished the task, which secured me my first internship. This
                        taught
                        me that joining communities and clubs is a fantastic way to connect with like-minded
                        individuals.
                        You not only learn from them but also get opportunities to collaborate with brilliant minds.</p>
                    <p>The biggest lesson was this: don't hesitate to try, even if you lack confidence. At worst, you
                        won't
                        succeed. Just give it a try and don't dwell on the outcome.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>You have the right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of
                            action.</p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>I look forward to applying these lessons in future endeavors! For now, adios!</p>
